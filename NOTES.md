1. get a template string parsed with babel
2. find out how to track a variable's state (map over AST ?)
3. create transform that can turn into state that redux can handle


1. split each line of the code string
2. map each line into components 
3. pass in current opacity etc (AST info as well?) to each component as props 
4. use that to transition between lines?
